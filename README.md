# CoffeeMachines test project

Simple project as hiring task.

## Task
Your task is to develop a monitoring application "The Caffeine Manager" which allows its users to manage and monitor their caffeine intoxication and helps them to administer their caffeine level. It does not need to have any UI, implementing the API only is sufficient. We are looking for reusable code. You are strongly encouraged to engineer this to display your software architecture and designing skills. Assume that this abstract application will be the first component of a large scale application.

## Specification:
Each POST/PUT request accepts a JSON object with keys described below

### Codes
Each request returns a JSON object with

- status 200 on success
- status 4xx with an optional JSON error object with mandatory keys
    - error_code
    - error_text
